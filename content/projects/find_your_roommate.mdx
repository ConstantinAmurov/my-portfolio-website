Find Your Roommate is a platform designed to assist students in finding compatible roommates and property owners in listing available accommodations. The project focuses on creating a user-friendly environment where students can search for roommates based on age, location, and common interests, while property owners can manage property listings.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Students can create profiles, specifying personal details and preferences.
- **Roommate Matching**: View potential roommates with a compatibility percentage based on shared interests and criteria.
- **Property Listings**: Property owners can register and add properties, allowing users to search and request accommodations.
- **Match Percentage Display**: Users can see how well they match with potential roommates.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - **React**: For building dynamic user interfaces.
  - **Redux**: State management.
  - **React Query**: Data fetching and synchronization.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: Styling and responsive design.
- **Backend**:
  - **Laravel**: Handling server-side logic and database interactions.

## Implementation
